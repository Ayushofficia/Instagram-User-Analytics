The Instagram User Analytics project is a tool designed to analyze Instagram user data and provide insights into various aspects such as follower growth, engagement rates, top-performing posts, and audience demographics. This project leverages Instagram's API (or a third-party service) to fetch data and perform comprehensive analyses to help users and businesses optimize their Instagram strategy.
